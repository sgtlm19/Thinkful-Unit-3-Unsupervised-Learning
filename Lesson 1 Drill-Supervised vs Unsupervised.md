    1.) Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease (SUPERVISED LEARNING)
  
    2.) Translate a set of images into variables for modeling (UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
  
    3.) An ecommerce company wants to identify power users (SUPERVISED LEARNING)
  
    4.) That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users (UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
